**Ticket ID:** APP-2025-0915-003  
**Priority:** Low  
**Status:** Open  
**Category:** Feature Request  

**Submitted By:** Mark Johnson (Compliance Department)  
**Date/Time:** 2025-09-15 4:40 PM

## Request Summary
The Compliance team requests the addition of a new field, **""Regulatory Reference ID""**, to the Compliance Case Management application. This field will allow us to track the corresponding regulatory requirement tied to each compliance case.

---

## Details
- **Field Name:** Regulatory Reference ID  
- **Type:** Text (alphanumeric, max length 50)  
- **Location:** Compliance Case record → Case Details section (after ""Case Description"")  
- **Required:** No (optional field)  
- **Default Value:** Blank  

---

## Business Justification
- Compliance analysts need to link each case to the appropriate regulation (e.g., HIPAA, SOX, GDPR).  
- Currently, this information is stored in free-text notes, which makes searching and reporting difficult.  
- Adding a dedicated field will improve data quality, reporting accuracy, and audit readiness.  

---

## Impact
- **Positive:** Easier tracking of regulatory cases, faster audits, and consistent data entry.  
- **Negative:** Minimal development and testing effort required.  

---

## Environment
- **Application:** Compliance Case Management v2.9.5  
- **Users Affected:** Compliance Department (15 analysts)  

---

## Attachments
- Screenshot mockup of proposed field placement.  

---

## Notes
Please include this field in reporting exports and API responses where case details are provided."
